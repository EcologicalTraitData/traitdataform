# traitdataform

This package assists in handling functional trait data from different sources by moulding them into a unified format. 

The toolset of the package includes

- matching of species names into GBIF Backbone Taxonomy (taxonomic ontology server)
- matching of trait names into a user-provided traitlist, i.e. a thesaurus of traits
- unifying trait values into target unit format and legit factor levels
- saving trait dataset into a desired format using templates (for BExIS)
- merging multiple datasets into one 

The package is based on the trait data core standard (Schneider, Simons, Penone, Ostrowski).
